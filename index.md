      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Nanjing University and have been studying at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
        through its VISP Pre-Master Program since Spring 2024. My research interests span a broad range of topics in physical mathematics, including 
        fluid dynamics, stochastic modeling, and dynamical systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        My current research, supervised by <a href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~spagnolie/">Prof. Saverio Spagnolie</a> and based on the work of 
        <a href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~tgchandler/">Dr. Thomas G. J. Chandler</a>, focuses on the elastic interaction of an immersed body 
        within a semi-infinite nematic liquid crystal. This project utilizes a blend of applied mathematical techniques, including asymptotic 
        analysis, numerical methods, and complex analysis, to tackle the unique challenges presented by the multiply-connected geometry in anisotropic 
        environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        More broadly, I am fascinated by the application of analytical mathematics to model physical systems, particularly where intricate 
        mathematical methods reveal insights into real-world phenomena. Recently, I found interest in the interactions of bodies and boundaries in 
        three-dimensional unsteady Stokes flow, which generally involves exploring the Maxey-Riley equation using the Laplace transform method and 
        Lorentz reciprocity principles.
