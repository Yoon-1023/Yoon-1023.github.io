## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics, focusing on complex analysis, fluid dynamics, and mathematical modeling. My research primarily involves using analytical and computational methods to solve problems in mathematical physics, particularly within the field of nematic liquid crystals and boundary value problems.

I am currently working under the supervision of [Saverio Spagnolie](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~spagnolie/) on the interaction of immersed bodies in semi-infinite nematic liquid crystals. I have also collaborated with [Jean-Luc Thiffeault](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~thiffeault/) and [Alexei Poltoratski](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~poltoratski/) on other projects in applied mathematics and complex analysis.
