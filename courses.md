# Advanced Topic Courses

## Fall 2024-MATH 801: Topics in Applied Mathematics(Dynamical Systems)
- **Instructor**: [Prof. Gheorghe Craciun](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~craciun/)
- **Content**: Study of Dynamical Systems and Applications, with special emphasis on mathematical models of reaction networks.  Introduction to population dynamics models that follow the law of mass-action. Study of mass-action systems is essentially equivalent to the study of polynomial dynamical systems on the positive orthant. Classes of mass-action systems (i.e., large classes of polynomial dynamical systems on the positive orthant) are known or conjectured to have remarkable qualitative properties: some have a globally attracting fixed point in the positive orthant (if the polynomials on the right-hand side have some special common solution), others have a globally attracting compact set within the positive orthant (if a graph associated to those polynomials has special reversibility properties). Key ideas and constructions that give rise to these results and conjectures.

## Fall 2024-MATH 821: Advanced Topics in Real Analysis(Nonlinear Wave Equations)
- **Instructor**: [Prof. Mihaela Ifrim](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~ifrim/)
- **Content**:  The objective of this course is to provide an introduction to nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, in particular nonlinear wave equations, with an emphasis on the "vector field method" as a key tool for understanding the long-time behavior of the solutions. We will illustrate this method with several applications, including a proof of the nonlinear global stability of Maxwell-Dirac systems in Minkowski space, as well as other interesting models, some of which arise in general relativity. 
 
The vector field method refers to a set of physical space techniques (as opposed to those relying on, say, Fourier or spectral analysis) that seeks to capture the long time dispersive behavior of solutions in a robust fashion. As the name suggests, the method revolves around the use of well-chosen vector fields on the background space-time, which are often related to exact or approximate symmetries of the equation. It has proven to be a very powerful tool in the study of highly nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, and continues to play a major role in recent breakthroughs.
 
A secondary goal  of the course will be to present the low regularity theory results associated to some of the most interesting models in this class of problems.  Our plan is to start from the very basics, beginning with the linear wave equation on $$R^{1+d}$$, and build our way up. Some open problems will also be discussed. Some prior general knowledge of PDE's will be assumed.
