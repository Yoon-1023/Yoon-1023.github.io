# Advanced Topic Courses

## Fall 2024 MATH 801: Topics in Applied Mathematics(Dynamical Systems)
- **Instructor**: [Prof. Gheorghe Craciun](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~craciun/)
- **Content**: Study of Dynamical Systems and Applications, with special emphasis on mathematical models of reaction networks.  Introduction to population dynamics models that follow the law of mass-action. Study of mass-action systems is essentially equivalent to the study of polynomial dynamical systems on the positive orthant. Classes of mass-action systems (i.e., large classes of polynomial dynamical systems on the positive orthant) are known or conjectured to have remarkable qualitative properties: some have a globally attracting fixed point in the positive orthant (if the polynomials on the right-hand side have some special common solution), others have a globally attracting compact set within the positive orthant (if a graph associated to those polynomials has special reversibility properties). Key ideas and constructions that give rise to these results and conjectures. 
- **Reading**:Stochastic integration and differential equations
