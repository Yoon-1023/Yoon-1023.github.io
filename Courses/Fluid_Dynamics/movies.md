## Videos

Below are some supplementary videos that illustrate core concepts from the course. Click on each video to watch.

### Video 1: Introduction to Fluid Kinematics

</video>

**Description**: This video provides an overview of fluid kinematics, covering the basic concepts of flow velocity and streamlines. The governing equations are introduced, including the continuity equation:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$
for incompressible flows.

**Description**: An introduction to the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous fluid flow. This video derives the equations and discusses their applications:
$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} \right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}.
$$

### Video 3: Vorticity Dynamics

</video>

**Description**: This video explores vorticity dynamics, including the evolution of vorticity in two-dimensional flows. We also discuss the vorticity transport equation:
$$
\frac{D \omega}{Dt} = (\omega \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} + \nu \nabla^2 \omega.
$$

**Description**: An overview of boundary layer theory, examining the formation and behavior of boundary layers in high Reynolds number flows.
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0.
$$
